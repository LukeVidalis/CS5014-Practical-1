# Predicting Energy Performance of Residential Buildings

This project was completed in the context of the `CS5014: Machine Learning` Module. It involves the creation of two machine learning models using:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forrest Regression

The models were used to predict the energy performance of different buildings using information derived from [this](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/energy+efficiency) dataset. More information about the implementation and testing of the project can be found in the [report](Report.pdf).
